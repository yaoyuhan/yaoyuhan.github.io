<h2>Physics of the Accretion Flow, Corona, and Jet in Tidal Disruption Events</h2> 
I am interested in the following two aspects of tidal disruption events (TDEs):<br>
* Understanding the real-time formation and evolution of the accretion disks, the corona, and relativistic jets
* Using TDEs as unique probes of the massive black hole population that are otherwise quiescent

With ZTF, we are systematically classifying all TDE candidates with a peak g-band magnitude brighter than 19.5. A reward of this effort is the discovery of an X-ray luminous TDE AT2021ehb. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12713">Yao et al. (2022)</a>, we show that AT2021ehb exhibited a novel soft → hard → soft X-ray spectral transition. We postulate that the initial soft → hard transition can be caused by delayed formation of a magnetically dominated corona. Since the later hard → soft transition is accompanied by a sudden drop of X-ray flux, we propose that it is triggered by thermal--viscous instability as the stellar debris fallback rate declines, which results in a thick → thin transition in the inner accretion flow. In the hard state NICER and NuSTAR spectra, I present the first detection of a prominent non-thermal X-ray component up to 30keV in a non-jetted TDE, as well as an extremely broad iron emission line indicative of relativistic disk reflection. My spectral modeling measures the ionization of the disk to be high (logξ~4) and the inclination to be i~43 deg. This work opens up the possibility for using next-generation X-ray instruments (such as <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/"XRISM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Telescope_for_High_Energy_Astrophysics">Athena</a>) to constrain the spin of quiescent BHs via TDE reflection spectroscopy.
