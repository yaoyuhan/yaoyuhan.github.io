<h4>Gaia eDR3 binary catalogs</h4>
The binary catalogs from the paper in the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210105282E/abstract">A million binaries from Gaia eDR3: sample selection and validation of Gaia parallax uncertainties
</a> is hosted <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4435257">on Zenodo</a>, along with the code to produce them. The fitting function to correct Gaia parallax uncertainties is in Equation 16 of that paper. 


<h4>Gaia DR2 wide binary catalogs</h4>
The catalog of high-confidence wide binaries within 200 pc produced in the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.4884E/abstract">Imprints of white dwarf recoil in the separation distribution of Gaia wide binaries</a> is available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dr2binaries200pc/data">here</a>. 
<br>
An expanded version of this catalog, which contains ~6 times more binaries, is hosted <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3437987">here</a>. It was produced by searching to larger distances and wider separations, and using less stringent cuts on astrometric signal-to-noise ratio.

<h4>Wide binaries with spectroscopic metallicities</h4>
The catalog of wide binaries within 200 pc that were observed by a spectroscopic survey and analyzed in the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482L.139E/abstract">The wide binary fraction of solar-type stars: emergence of metallicity dependence at a < 200 AU</a> is available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dr2binariesspectra/data">here</a>.

<h4>Separation distribution inference</h4>
The code used to infer the intrinsic separation distribution of wide binaries (correcting for incompleteness at small separations) in the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.4884E/abstract">Imprints of white dwarf recoil in the separation distribution of Gaia wide binaries</a> is available <a href="https://github.com/kareemelbadry/sep_dist">here</a>.

<h4>Initial-final mass relation</h4>
A tabulated version of the IFMR derived in the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860L..17E/abstract">An empirical measurement of the initial-final mass relation with Gaia white dwarfs</a> is available <a href="https://kareemelbadry.github.io/files/ElBadry_Gaia_IFMR.txt">here</a>.


<h4>Spectral models</h4>
A public version of the code <i>BinSpec</i>, which models and fits spectra of single- and multiple-star systems, is available on available <a href="https://github.com/kareemelbadry/binspec">on GitHub</a>

<h4>Spectroscopic binary catalogs</h4>
Several catalogs accompanying the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476..528E/abstract">Discovery and characterization of 3000+ main-sequence binaries from APOGEE spectra</a> are available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/apogeebinaries/data">here</a>.

<h4>FIRE galaxy simulation angular momentum</h4>
True and mock-observed baryon angular momenta for simulated galaxies from the paper  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473.1930E/abstract">Gas kinematics, morphology and angular momentum in the FIRE simulations</a> are available <a href="https://kareemelbadry.github.io/files/FIRE_j_baryon.txt">here</a>.
