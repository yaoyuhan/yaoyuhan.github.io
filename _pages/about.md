My name is Yuhan Yao (姚雨含). I'm currently a [Miller Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Research_Fellows) in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. 

I am interested in time domain astronomy and high energy astrophysics. I use wide-field sky surveys and targeted multi-wavelength observations to study the physics of energetic transients, such as the disruption of stars by massive black holes and the explosions of stars.

Before coming to Berkeley, I obtained my [PhD in Astrophysics](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/15204/) from Caltech, and received my B.S. in Astronomy from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

In September 2026, I will be joining the [Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University as an Assistant Professor.

I am always open to and excited about collaborations. Please reach out if you are interested!
