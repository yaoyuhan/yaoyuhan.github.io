I'm a fouth-year graduate student in Astronomy at  [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). My advisors are [Shri Kulkarni](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/) and [Fiona Harrison](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/personnel/fiona/).

My research is focused on time domain astronomy and observational high energy astrophysics. I am part of the [Zwicky Transient Facility](http://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf) (ZTF) and [NuSTAR](https://heag.caltech.edu/) teams. In the past, I have worked on supernovae, X-ray binaries, and stars. For my PhD thesis, I explore the dynamic sky using ZTF, Keck and Palomar telescopes, and many high energy X-ray missions ([XMM-Newton](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/), [Swift](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [NuSTAR](https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/),    [Chandra](https://chandra.harvard.edu/), [NICER](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/),    [SRG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spektr-RG)), with the goal of understanding the accretion and jet physics of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and stellar explosions with intensive end-of-life mass-loss.

I grew up in Beijing, China. I was an undergraduate at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (B.S., astronomy, 2018). As an undergraduate, I used LAMOST to study Mira stars, under the instruction of Chao Liu, Licai Deng, and [Richard de Grijs](http://astro-expat.info/about.html). I did my undergrad thesis to understand the evolution of primordial disks at the University of Michigan, where my mentor was [Michael Meyer](https://lsa.umich.edu/astro/people/core-faculty/mrmeyer.html). I also spent some time at Tsinghua University, working with [Hua Feng](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~hfeng/) to study outflows generated by super-Eddington accretion.
