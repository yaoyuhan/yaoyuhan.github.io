My name is Yuhan Yao (姚雨含). I'm a [Miller Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Research_Fellows) in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. 

I am interested in time domain astronomy and high energy astrophysics. I use wide-field sky surveys and targeted multi-wavelength observations to study the physics of energetic transients, such as the disruption of stars by massive black holes and the explosions of stars.

Before coming to Berkeley, I obtained my [PhD in Astrophysics](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/15204/) from Caltech, and received my B.S. in Astronomy from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

<!-- I go by "she/her" pronouns. I'm happy to talk anytime with students interested in working on a research project.-->
