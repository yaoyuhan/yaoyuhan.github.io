<h3>SN2019dge</h3>  
Code used to produce all figures in the paper [SN2019dge: a Helium-rich Ultra-Stripped Envelope Supernova](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abaa3d) is available at [this github repository](https://github.com/yaoyuhan/SN2019dge).

<h3>AT2020mrf</h3>  
Code used to produce all figures in the paper [The X-ray and Radio Loud Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2020mrf: Implications for an Emerging Class of Engine-driven Massive Star Explosions](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7a41) is available at [this github repository](https://github.com/yaoyuhan/AT2020mrf).

<h3>ZTF Forced Photometry</h3>
Code used to perform forced PSF photometry on ZTF difference images is available at [this github repository](https://github.com/yaoyuhan/ForcePhotZTF). A description of this method is provided in the paper [ZTF Early Observations of Type Ia Supernovae. I. Properties of the 2018 Sample](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab4cf5)
